## Introducing convolutional networks

Adjacent networks (every node is connected to every node in output layer) does not take into account 

Convolutional networks create a spatial architecture that allows the training of deep, many-layer networks, which are very good at classifying images.

#### Local receptive fields

In the fully-connected layers shown earlier, the inputs were depicted as a vertical line of neurons.

In a convNet, it'll help to think of inputs as a square 2D array of neurons.
