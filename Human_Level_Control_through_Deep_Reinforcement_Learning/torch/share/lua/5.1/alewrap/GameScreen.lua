-- This file defines the alewrap.GameScreen class.

--[[ The GameScreen class is designed to efficiently combine a fixed number
of consecutive images of identical dimensions coming in a sequence

Several Atari games (e.g. Space Invaders, Ms. Pacman, Alien, etc.) contain
blinking sprites, or important game objects which are drawn every other frame
for technical reasons (e.g. asteroids in the eponymous game). Using single
frames as state, even when sampled at a fixed interval, can miss many such
elements, with possibly severe consequences during gameplay (e.g. bullets
blink in most games). Pooling over consecutive frames reduces the risk of
missing such game elements.

The GameScreen class allows users to `paint` individual frames on a simulated
screen and then `grab` the mean/max/etc of the last N painted frames. The
default configuration will return the mean over the last two consecutive frames.

--[[ Clear frame buffer without releasing storage.

New input frames must have the same dimensions as first inputs.

This method is faster than calling `reset`, which incurs an extra, one-off
cost for reallocating storage, but allows frames with a different dimension to
be used.

--[[ Reset frame buffer settings and release storage.

New input frames must be of the same shape, but that needs not be the same
with dimensions of previous inputs. The screen can also be switched to
use CPU/GPU operations.

Calling `reset` incurs a one-off cost for reallocating storage. If new input
frames will have the same dimension and the same type of CPU/GPU operations
will be used, then it is faster to call `clear` instead of `reset`.
